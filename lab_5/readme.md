This directory contains my work for lab_5.

RECENT UPDATES

This lab uses the vector array from lab 3 as my heap structure. I am still learning how to combine my files so that they can run together. I also wanted to add an ordering function in my max_heap.c file, but it is not currently working so I may need to refactor some things.

TESTING

Upcoming tests:
1. Run a small test with a simple print statement to get makefile working correctly
2. Create a test for the ordering function in my max_heap.c file. I may need to rethink how I have chosen to structure this heap.
