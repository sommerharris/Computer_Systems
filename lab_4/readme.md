The files I created for the lab 4 assignment are titled:

As I try to get the history running, I have 'test_print_statement' files with which I am learning how header files work and how to combine these files to get them running. I may need to add a makefile.

individual_lab2.c and shell_history_structure.c
I also created a header file for shell_history_structure.c
The shell_history_structure file contains an array data structure, and relevant functions for adding and removing from this data structure.
The individual_lab2 file is the original shell, with pieces that I added in to integrate the history function. The changes to this file were 
including the history file (line 1), writing to the history strucutre (line 131 to 135) and in the main loop, loading up the history and 
cleaning up after the main loop runs(lines 257 to 276).
