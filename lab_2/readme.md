The shell script in this directory was created using this tutorual, :
https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/
by Stephen Brennan

The shell contains the commands "cd", "help", and "exit".
I compile it with gcc.

I deleted my first attempt at this tutorial, from a few weeks ago, and my most recent attempt, 
(which now compiles and runs) is in shell_script_two.c.
