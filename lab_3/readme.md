This directory contains the assignments for lab_3. 

The first assignment (individual_lab_array.c) is an array in a vector. It compiles in clang and I have been running it in the command line. I still wish to add more functions, as identified in the assignment outline.

The second assignment (singly_linked_list.c) is an updated version of (individual_lab_singly_linked.c). It is an array in a singly linked list. It will compiles in clang and I have run it in the command line.

The third assignment (individual_lab_doubly_linked.c) is an array in a doubly linked list. It will compile in clang and I have will run it in the command line. I am still working on getting it compiling and running. I still wish to add more functions, as identified in the assignment outline.

This directory also contains 'test_file.c', which I used to familiarize myself with pointers and dereferencing and printing, and pointers_array.PNG is an image of notes from my study around arrays, pointers, dereferencing, etc.

TO DO:
1. Add the remaining recommended functions to individual_lab3_array.c
2. Create tests for individual_lab_doubly_linked.c to resolve errors, and add remaining recommended functions.
3. Develop test harnesses for these three files.
